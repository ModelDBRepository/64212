NEURON model files from the papers:
Shimazaki et al, Chem. Senses, in press (2006)
Electrophysiological properties and modeling of murine vomeronasal 
sensory neurons in acute slice preparations.

The model reproduces quantitatively the experimentally observed 
firing rates of these neurons under a wide range of input currents.

Running the vno.hoc simulation file will allow  
to reproduce the traces in Fig.7 of the paper.

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui vno.hoc

Under Windows:
to compile the mod files use the "mknrndll" command.
A double click on the simulation file
vno.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Questions on this model should be directed to
